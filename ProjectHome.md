The software, “GREED,” is a stock market simulator intended to allow users to start and manage their portfolios while buying and selling stocks; also it must allow users to engage in competitions with other users in the system. It must provide detailed information of current stock prices, portfolio updates, and competition updates. This information is to be displayed in both text and graphical representations. GREED is to also provide a “What if” simulator; this retrieves historical data and gives the user an idea of how successful or unsuccessful they would be after buying a specific stock.  The software is expected to work on Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari.
